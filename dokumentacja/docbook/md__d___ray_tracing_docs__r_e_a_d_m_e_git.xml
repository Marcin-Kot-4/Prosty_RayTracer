<para>The latest development version of SDL is available via git. Git allows you to get up-to-the-minute fixes and enhancements; as a developer works on a source tree, you can use &quot;git&quot; to mirror that source tree instead of waiting for an official release. Please look at the Git website ( <link xlink:href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</link> ) for more information on using git, where you can also download software for macOS, Windows, and Unix systems. <literallayout><computeroutput>git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
