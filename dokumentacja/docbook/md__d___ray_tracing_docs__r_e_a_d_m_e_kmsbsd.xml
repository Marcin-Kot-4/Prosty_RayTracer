<para>KMSDRM is supported on FreeBSD and OpenBSD. DragonFlyBSD works but requires being a root user. NetBSD isn&apos;t supported yet because the application will crash when creating the KMSDRM screen.</para>

<para>WSCONS support has been brought back, but only as an input backend. It will not be brought back as a video backend to ease maintenance.</para>

<para>OpenBSD note: Note that the video backend assumes that the user has read/write permissions to the /dev/drm* devices.</para>
