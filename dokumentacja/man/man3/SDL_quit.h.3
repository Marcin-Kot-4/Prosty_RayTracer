.PP 
Include file for SDL quit event handling\&.
.PP
An \fBSDL_QUIT\fP event is generated when the user tries to close the application window\&. If it is ignored or filtered out, the window will remain open\&. If it is not ignored or filtered, it is queued normally and the window is allowed to close\&. When the window is closed, screen updates will complete, but have no effect\&.
.PP
\fBSDL_Init()\fP installs signal handlers for SIGINT (keyboard interrupt) and SIGTERM (system termination request), if handlers do not already exist, that generate \fBSDL_QUIT\fP events as well\&. There is no way to determine the cause of an \fBSDL_QUIT\fP event, but setting a signal handler in your application will override the default generation of quit events for that signal\&.
