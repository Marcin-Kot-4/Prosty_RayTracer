A pandora specific video driver was written to allow SDL 2\&.0 with OpenGL ES support to work on the pandora under the framebuffer\&. This driver do not have input support for now, so if you use it you will have to add your own control code\&. The video driver name is 'pandora' so if you have problem running it from the framebuffer, try to set the following variable before starting your application : 'export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=pandora'

OpenGL ES support was added to the x11 driver, so it's working like the normal x11 driver one with OpenGLX support, with SDL input event's etc\&.\&.
