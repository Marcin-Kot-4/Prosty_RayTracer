.SH "Compiling:"
.PP
Currently, SDL2 for RISC OS only supports compiling with GCCSDK under Linux\&. Both the autoconf and CMake build systems are supported\&.
.PP
The following commands can be used to build SDL2 for RISC OS using autoconf: 
.PP
.nf
\&./configure --host=arm-unknown-riscos --prefix=$GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV --disable-gcc-atomics
make
make install

.fi
.PP
 The following commands can be used to build SDL2 for RISC OS using CMake: 
.PP
.nf
cmake -Bbuild-riscos -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV/toolchain-riscos\&.cmake -DRISCOS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSDL_GCC_ATOMICS=OFF
cmake --build build-riscos
cmake --build build-riscos --target install

.SH "Current level of implementation"
.PP
The video driver currently provides full screen video support with keyboard and mouse input\&. Windowed mode is not yet supported, but is planned in the future\&. Only software rendering is supported\&.
.PP
The filesystem APIs return either Unix-style paths or RISC OS-style paths based on the value of the \fC__riscosify_control\fP symbol, as is standard for UnixLib functions\&.
.PP
The audio, loadso, thread and timer APIs are currently provided by UnixLib\&.
.PP
GCC atomics are currently broken on some platforms, meaning it's currently necessary to compile with \fC--disable-gcc-atomics\fP using autotools or \fC-DSDL_GCC_ATOMICS=OFF\fP using CMake\&.
.PP
The joystick, locale and power APIs are not yet implemented\&.
