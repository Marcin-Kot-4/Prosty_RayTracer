Get the current power supply details\&.
.PP
You should never take a battery status as absolute truth\&. Batteries (especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports\&. It's not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it reports, or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc\&.
.PP
Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power state, you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes until they seem to be stable for a few seconds\&.
.PP
It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left but not both\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIsecs\fP seconds of battery life left, you can pass a NULL here if you don't care, will return -1 if we can't determine a value, or we're not running on a battery 
.br
\fIpct\fP percentage of battery life left, between 0 and 100, you can pass a NULL here if you don't care, will return -1 if we can't determine a value, or we're not running on a battery
